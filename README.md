# Bash script for CCTV footage recorder.
-  I have a Linux server setup at home and a Tp-Link Tapo camera and it has a SD-card slot for storage, I thought if someone tries to tamper with the camera there might be a chance that the SD card can also get tampered.
-  So why not store it somewhere safe.
-  The code is inside the code.sh file.
-  This script uses ffmpeg for recording and saving it.
-  There are various fields that needs to updated before running it.
-  This script should be setup as a systemd program , so that it can run with any issues.
